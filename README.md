# About Me 

#### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm ThÃ©o(phile) Carrasco !

I am a Game Developper student in 2nd year master's degree at [ENJMIN](https://enjmin.cnam.fr/enjmin/ecole-nationale-du-jeu-et-des-medias-interactifs-accueil-1126103.kjsp) 
with a passion for bringing immersive experiences to life through code, design, and creativity !
My goal is to specialize in Engine Programming, contributing to the technology that powers games and interactive experiences. 
I'm also taking an interest in developing retro games, in particular by learning how to develop games for the classic Game Boy.
